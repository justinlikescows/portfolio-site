# Hello Everyone.

Welcome to my public journal, where I will document all of my thoughts and progress, in my professional and personal life.
Though this in a sense is dystopian, being that I am basically talking to you all through a screen, there is something oddly comforting about it to me.
The ability to talk to complete strangers, who I will probably never meet. I can speak my mind with little consequence. 

**Anonymity is comfortability.**

Okay thats all for today! Tomorrow will be a whole yap session.
